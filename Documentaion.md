### Code Documentation

***remoteJobsSlice.js***

This code file defines a Redux slice for managing remote jobs. It exports an initial state object, action creators, and a reducer function. The code uses the createSlice and createAsyncThunk functions from the @reduxjs/toolkit package and the axios library for making HTTP requests.

The initial state object has the following properties:

- **jobs:** An array to store remote job data.
- **status:** A string representing the current status of the job fetching process.
- **error:** An object representing any error that occurred during job fetching.

The code exports the *fetchRemoteJobs* async thunk, which is used to fetch remote job data from the Remotive API. It makes an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint and returns the fetched job data. If an error occurs during the request, it throws an error with the message "Failed to fetch jobs."

The code defines a *jobsSlice* using the *createSlice* function. It configures the slice with a name, initial state, reducers, and extra reducers.

The reducers handle updating the state when actions are dispatched:

- **findJobDetails:** Updates the jobs array by setting the details property of the job with the specified ID to false.
- **noJobDetails:** Updates the jobs array by setting the details property of the job with the specified ID to true.

The extra reducers handle updating the state based on the lifecycle of the *fetchRemoteJobs* async thunk:

- **fetchRemoteJobs.pending:** Sets the status to 'loading' when the fetch request is pending.
- **fetchRemoteJobs.fulfilled:** Sets the status to 'succeeded' and updates the jobs array with the fetched job data when the fetch request is successful.
- **fetchRemoteJobs.rejected:** Sets the status to 'failed' and stores the error message in the error property when the fetch request fails.
Finally, the code exports the action creators findJobDetails and noJobDetails, as well as the reducer function as the default export.

***Jobs.js***

This code file defines a React component Jobs responsible for rendering and managing the display of remote jobs. It uses Redux hooks such as useSelector and useDispatch to interact with the Redux store and dispatch actions.

The component imports the necessary dependencies, including the Navigation component, Redux actions from *remoteJobsSlice*, and an image asset.

The Jobs component contains a functional component that fetches remote jobs using the fetchRemoteJobs action upon component mount. It renders a loading message if the jobs array is empty.

The component defines a *handleJobDetails* function that dispatches the *findJobDetails* or *noJobDetails* action based on the job's details property. It then navigates to the job details page using the useNavigate hook.

The render method returns JSX elements that display the navigation, job list, and associated details. The job list is rendered using the jobs array, and each job item has a button that triggers the *handleJobDetails* function.

The Jobs component is exported as the default export.

***JobDetails.js***

This code file defines a React component *JobDetails* responsible for rendering and displaying details of a selected job. It uses the useSelector hook to access selected job details from the Redux store.

The component imports the necessary dependencies, including the *Navigation* component and icons.

The *JobDetails* component fetches the selected job details from the Redux store by filtering the jobs array based on the details property. It then renders the job details using JSX elements.

The render method returns JSX elements that display the navigation and job details. The job details are rendered based on the selected job details retrieved from the Redux store.

The *JobDetails* component is exported as the default export.

***Navigation.js***

This code file defines a React component Navigation responsible for rendering a navigation bar. It receives the text and year props to display appropriate content.

The component imports the necessary dependencies, including icons.

The Navigation component renders a navigation bar with three elements: a back button, a title, and settings icons.

The render method returns JSX elements that display the navigation bar with the provided content.

The Navigation component is exported as the default export.

***store.js***

This code file creates and configures the Redux store using the configureStore function from the @reduxjs/toolkit package. It imports the *jobsReducer* from the remoteJobsSlice file.

The code creates the store by passing a reducer object with the jobs slice reducer to the configureStore function.

The created store is exported as the default export.

***App.js***

This code file defines the main entry point of the React application. It uses the BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components from the react-router-dom package for handling routing.

The component imports the necessary dependencies, including the Jobs and JobDetails components.

The App component renders the top-level structure of the application using the BrowserRouter. It defines two routes: one for the Jobs component and one for the JobDetails component. The routes are rendered within the Routes component.

The App component is exported as the default export.
